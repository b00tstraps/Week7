**VERY EASY:** Create and add three elements of your choice to the page.
  
**EASY:** Create a button that when you click on it, it toggles a message inside of a div. Using a condition that you create (hint: checking if a random number is of a certain value), toggle the message fast or slow.
If the condition is TRUE, toggle the message fast. If the condition is FALSE, toggle the message slow.
  
**MEDIUM:** Using the jQuery validation plug in, validate a form that you create. Must contain full name, address, state, city, zip, email and telephone number.
  
**HARD:**
`<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>`
`<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>`
`<a href="http://www.redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>`
Given these 3 a tags in an HTML document, write a script that adds a target="_blank" property to each a tag and then add a title property to each a tag with the same URL that is in the href property.
For example, the Red Ventures link should look like this: `<a href="http://www.redventures.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.redventures.com">Red Ventures</a>`
  
**VERY HARD:**
Using jQuery, create a Tabata timer that has the following features:
1. Ask users how many sets they want to do
2. Ask users how long the activity in each set should be. Default to 20 seconds.
3. Ask users how long the rest period between each set should be. Default to 10 seconds.
4. Allow the user to start the timer once those questions have been answered.
5. Allow the user to stop the timer at any time after it has started.
6. Visually count down each activity period and then each rest period.
7. Make sure it is visually clear which period is currently being counted down.
8. If the user finishes all of the sets they created, congratulate them at the end.
9. Use CSS to make it look good on the desktop and also on a phone.
10. For extra credit use CSS or jQuery animations for the countdown.
